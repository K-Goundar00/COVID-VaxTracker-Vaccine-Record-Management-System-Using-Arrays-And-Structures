# COVID-VaxTracker-Vaccine-Record-Management-System-Using-Arrays-And-Structures

## Overview

This simple C++ program is a menu-driven system designed to manage and analyze COVID-19 vaccination records. It reads data from three external text files—citizens, vaccines, and vaccinations—and stores them using arrays and structures. The system allows users to view detailed records, search for individual vaccination data, and receive vaccine recommendations based on age and dose history.

## Features

- Load citizen, vaccine, and vaccination data from external text files
- Store data using arrays and user-defined structures
- Display full lists of citizens (with age calculated), vaccines, and vaccination data
- Search for a citizen by ID and display complete vaccination details
- Generate personalized vaccine recommendations based on eligibility rules
- Validate menu inputs and handle incorrect user choices gracefully

## Menu Options

When executed, the program displays the following options:

1. Exit  
2. Print all citizens (including calculated age)  
3. Print all vaccines  
4. Print complete vaccination data (merged with citizen and vaccine info)  
5. Search a citizen by ID and display vaccination status  
6. Print vaccine recommendations for all citizens
